Project 2 - Basic Raycaster


In this project we are meant to write code to raycast mathematical primitives based on a scene input file
into a pixel buffer. We will then write the pixel buffer to a PPM formatted file using the code
you wrote in Project 1 (P6 format).

I had a lot of problems with this project. I needed to totally re-establish my structures and ended up only make one big one.
It worked far better for what I ended up doing with my object array.
Lastly, trying to transcribe the pseudocode of nested for loops for the rayCast function was near to impossible in my eyes at first.
